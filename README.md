# What Is This?
This is a simple web application that allows a user to view the current location of an MBTA Commuter Rail train. A user can select the line they're interested in, the direction they wish to travel (Inbound or Outbound), and when they hit Submit, the train's current location is shown on a map.

The app was built using Python3 and Flask, as well as the MBTA and Google Maps API.

# What's Next?
Here are my upcoming plans to improve this app:
- Need a way to handle multiple trains traveling on the same line in the same direction at the same time.
- I'd like to show each train's progress on the map as it moves along its route.
- Need to clean up the Maps page. The code is a mess.
- Better error handling!
- A pin should be dropped on the map at the train's location, rather than just centering the map on the train's coordinates.

# Addional Notes
I am not interested in any contributions at this time. This is strictly a personal project.
