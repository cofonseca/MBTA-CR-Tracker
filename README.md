# What Is This?
This is a simple web application that allows a user to view the current location of an MBTA Commuter Rail train. A user can select the line they're interested in, the direction they wish to travel (Inbound or Outbound), and when they hit Submit, the train's current location is shown on a map.

The app was built using Python3 and Flask, as well as the MBTA and Google Maps API.

# What's Next?
Here are my upcoming plans to improve this app:
- I'd like to show each train's progress on the map as it moves along its route, including a line from the source station to the destination station.
- If a user selects a sub-line, such as Stoughton (Which is actually part of the Providence line according to the API), it still shows Providence trains.
- When browsing all trains, they all show up in one massive list. This should be better organized.

# Addional Notes
I am not interested in any contributions at this time. This is strictly a personal project.
